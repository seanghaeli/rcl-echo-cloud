# Requirements
Before you deploy, you must have the following in place:
*  [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/) 
*  [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) 
*  [Node 10 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
*  [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    * [Configure default profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-methods)

For prototyping, you need the following:
*  [Python 3.7 or greater](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) 
*  [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) 
*  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 

# Step 1: Back-end deployment

In this step we will execute three Cloudformation scripts:
* [cfn-vpc](../cfn/cfn-vpc.yaml) - This Cloudformation create the networking for the image creation EC2 instance, Lambda functions and EC2 instances that processes the model.
* [cfn-imageBuilder](../cfn/cfn-imageBuilder.yaml) - It creates the EC2 Image Builder infrastructure that embeds the model into our custom AMI. 
* [cfn-backend](../cfn/cfn-backend.yaml) - Responsible for the creation of the underlying infrastructure of the solution. It includes the EC2 Auto Scaling configuration, SQS, VPC Endpoints, EFS, and CloudFront


## Step 1.1: VPC

1. Log into the CloudFormation Management Console.
2. Select 'Create Stack' with the 'With new resources (standard)' option.
3. Click 'Upload a template file', and then 'Choose file' and select the **cfn-vpc.yaml** located in the /cfn directory of the repo
4. Click Next.
5. Give the Stack name a name (e.g. rcl-echo-cloud-vpc).

## Step 1.2: EC2 Image Builder

#TODO: uploading private container to ECR

1.  You also need the latest Deep Learning Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Id in the step. Please, run the command below to obtain it. **Make sure you run this command on the region you are executing the solution, and also make sure your default profile is configured.**
```bash
aws ec2 describe-images \
    --owners amazon \
    --filters 'Name=name,Values=Deep Learning Base AMI (Amazon Linux 2)*' 'Name=state,Values=available' \
    --query 'reverse(sort_by(Images, &CreationDate))[:1].ImageId' \
    --output text
```

2. Log into the CloudFormation Management Console.
3. Select 'Create Stack' with the 'With new resources (standard)' option.
4. Click 'Upload a template file', and then 'Choose File' and select the **cfn-ImageBuilder.yaml** located in the /cfn directory of the repo
5. Click Next.
6. Give the Stack name a name (e.g. rcl-echo-cloud-ImageBuilder).
7. Select a key-pair. If you donâ€™t have any Amazon EC2 key-pair available [create-your-key-pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair), and repeat this step.
8. On the AmazonLinuxAMI paste the AMI ID from the command listed at beginning of this step.

:warning: **Important Note**: This step takes approximately 40min-60min as it spins up an instance and runs all the steps to create the AMI. **Make sure it finishes successfully to move to the next step**

## Step 1.3: Backend

1. Log into the CloudFormation Management Console.
2. Select 'Create Stack' with the 'With new resources (standard)' option.
3. Click 'Upload a template file', and then 'Choose File' and select the **cfn-backend.yaml** located in the /cfn directory of the repo
4. Click Next.
5. Give the Stack name a name (e.g. covid-19-app-ImageBuilder).
6. Select a key-pair that you have defined on Step 2.1 item 7.
7. On the S3Bucket field, find the name by going to S3 Management Console page and copying the name of the associated bucket which will be of the following form:
   * rcl-echo-cloud-imagebuilder-imagebuilderlogbucket-[unique identifier]


# Step 2: Lambda Function

## 2.1: Creating the Lambda Layer
When an echo ultrasound is submitted to be processed, a Lambda function is triggered to perform inference on the view-classifier model on any .mat data loaded to S3 bucket, and uploads output to the same bucket. **Make sure your default profile is configured.**

1. Go to the directory <strong>/backend/lambda</strong> and execute:
```bash
deploy.sh 
```

# Resource: Front-end deployment

* This front-end exists from a previous app ([here](https://github.com/UBC-CIC/COVID19-L3-Net-APP)) and has not been modified to fit our needs. However, feel free to use this deployment guide as a baseline.
* Download [Amplify CLI installed and configured](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart#quickstart)

1.  Clone and Fork this solution repository.
    If you haven't configured Amplify before, configure the Amplify CLI in your terminal as follows:
```bash
amplify configure
```

2.  In a terminal from the project root directory, enter the following command selecting the IAM user of the AWS Account you will deploy this application from. (accept all defaults):

```bash
amplify init
```

3.  Deploy the resource to your AWS Account using the command:
```bash
amplify push
```

4.  After the Amplify deployment finishes, run the command below to obtain the Amazon S3 Bucket Amplify created. This information will be used later as a parameter in a CloudFormation
```bash
aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources --tag-filters Key=user:Application,Values="rcl-echo-cloud" Key=user:Stack,Values="dev" --resource-type-filters s3 --query 'ResourceTagMappingList[*].[ResourceARN]' --output text | grep -v deployment | awk -F':::' '{print $2}'
```

5. Log into the AWS Management Console.
6. Select AWS Amplify and select the 'rcl-echo-cloud'
7. At the *Frontend environments* tab connect to your GitHub account pointing to the forked repo. More information at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/deploy-backend.html
